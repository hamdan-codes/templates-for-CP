## This is a template used by me in various CP contests and for practicing CP.
## I use Sublime test 3 nowadays, as it's way too easy to handle as compared to VSC (XD).
## The below SS shows my window layout
<img src="https://github.com/hamdan-codes/templates-for-CP/blob/main/Template-SS.PNG?raw=true" alt="CP Window Look" width="800">

### To make the window look like this, follow the following steps:
#### 1. Click on View menu -> Layout -> Columns:3
#### 2. Open the input and output text files in the two extra columns
#### 3. Then click on View Menu -> Group -> Max Columns:2

# And you are ready : )

### Thank You
